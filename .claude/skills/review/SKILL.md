  Code review skill for Node.js Express API and Svelte WebComponent projects.
  Analyzes code for bugs, performance issues, readability, and security vulnerabilities.
  Produces a markdown report first, then applies fixes after user approval.
  Use this skill whenever the user asks to: "review code", "check for bugs",
  "security audit", "performance analysis", "code quality check", "refactor suggestions",
  "review", "inspect", or any code quality assessment request.
  Even if no specific file or folder is mentioned, this skill can review the entire project.

# Code Review Skill

This skill systematically reviews a codebase and produces a two-phase output:
1. **Report** — A markdown report with findings, severity levels, and explanations
2. **Fix** — Apply suggested fixes after user approval

## Supported Projects

| Project Type | Tech Stack | Key Focus Areas |
|---|---|---|
| API | Node.js, Express, JavaScript | Route security, middleware, error handling, async/await, DB queries |
| Frontend | Svelte, WebComponents | Reactivity, lifecycle, DOM manipulation, prop management, accessibility |

## When Review is Triggered

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` first — learn the project rules and structure
2. Scan the file/folder specified by the user, or the entire project
3. Follow the review pipeline below

---

## Review Pipeline

### Step 1: Determine Scope

Focus on what the user specified. If nothing was specified:

- Check recent changes with `git diff` or `git diff --staged`
- If no changes exist or the user said "review the whole project", scan all source files
- Skip these files: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.env`, `package-lock.json`, `*.min.js`

```bash
# Find changed files
git diff --name-only HEAD~1
# Or all source files
find src/ -type f \( -name "*.js" -o -name "*.svelte" -o -name "*.ts" \)
```

### Step 2: Read and Analyze Files

Read each file and examine it across the 4 categories below. Assign a severity level to each finding:

| Level | Emoji | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | 🔴 | Must fix immediately — bug, security vulnerability, data loss risk |
| Warning | 🟡 | Should fix — performance issue, bad practice, potential bug |
| Suggestion | 🔵 | Improvement opportunity — readability, refactoring, best practice |
| Info | ⚪ | Note — alternative approach, explanation, or praise |

### Step 3: Category-Based Checklists

#### 🐛 Bugs & Errors

**General:**
- Uncaught exceptions, missing try/catch blocks
- Variables not checked for null/undefined
- Incorrect logical conditions (off-by-one errors, wrong operators)
- Race condition risks
- Incorrect or missing error handling

**Express API specific:**
- Uncaught Promise rejections in `async` route handlers
- Middleware that never calls `next()`
- Sending a response after one has already been sent (code after `res.send()`)
- Missing `return` statements in route handlers

**Svelte specific:**
- Reactivity issues (updates not triggered by `$:`)
- `onMount` / `onDestroy` lifecycle errors
- Event listeners not cleaned up on component destruction
- Mutation issues on bound variables

#### ⚡ Performance

**General:**
- Unnecessary loops, nested loops (O(n²) and above)
- Memory leak risks (uncleared listeners, timers, subscriptions)
- Missing pagination/limits on large data sets

**Express API specific:**
- N+1 query problems
- Middleware ordering (heavy middleware running unnecessarily early)
- Returning unnecessarily large payloads in responses
- Missing caching opportunities
- Synchronous file operations (`fs.readFileSync` etc.)

**Svelte specific:**
- Reactive statements triggering unnecessary re-renders
- Missing `key` in `each` blocks
- Missing virtualization for large lists
- Heavy computations inside components (should use derived stores or memoization)

#### 📖 Clean Code & Readability

- Function length (evaluate if 30+ lines should be broken up)
- Unclear variable/function names
- Magic numbers and hardcoded strings
- Repeated code blocks (DRY violations)
- Missing or misleading comments
- Inconsistent code style (naming conventions, indentation)
- File organization and modularity
- Complex conditionals (could be simplified with early returns)

#### 🔒 Security

**Express API specific (priority):**
- SQL/NoSQL injection risks (unparameterized queries)
- XSS vulnerabilities (unsanitized user input)
- CORS configuration (overly permissive `*` usage)
- Missing rate limiting
- Authentication/authorization bypass risks
- Logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Missing security middleware (Helmet, CSRF protection)
- Hardcoded secrets in `.env` or source files
- Vulnerable dependencies

**Svelte specific:**
- Rendering unsanitized content with `{@html}`
- Storing sensitive data on the client side
- Injection risks in event handlers

## Step 4: Present Findings

Do NOT create a separate report file. Present findings directly in the conversation.

### Format

Start with a quick summary table:

| Category | 🔴 Critical | 🟡 Warning | 🔵 Suggestion | ⚪ Info |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bugs & Errors | X | X | X | X |
| Performance | X | X | X | X |
| Readability | X | X | X | X |
| Security | X | X | X | X |

Then list findings grouped by severity (🔴 first, then 🟡, 🔵, ⚪). For each finding:

- **File:** `path/to/file.js:line`
- **Issue:** What's wrong and why it matters
- **Fix:** What the fix would look like

Keep it concise — no need for lengthy explanations. After presenting all findings, immediately ask:

> "Should I go ahead and fix these? All of them, or specific ones?"

### Presentation Rules

- Every finding must be concrete — include file name and line number
- Don't just state the problem, explain why it's a problem
- Include a fix suggestion for every finding
- If the same pattern repeats across multiple files, group them into a single finding
- Note positive things too — highlight well-written sections as ⚪ Info

## Step 5: Apply Fixes

After user approval:

1. Fix **Critical** findings first
2. Fix **Warning** findings next
3. Fix **Suggestion** findings only if the user requests it
4. Briefly explain what changed after each fix

---

## Special Cases

### Only specific files requested for review
Focus on those files only, but consider their dependencies for context.

### "Quick review" requested
Focus only on 🔴 Critical and 🟡 Warning levels. Keep the report short.

### PR / commit review requested
Focus on `git diff` output. Only review changed lines, but read surrounding code for context.

### Security-focused review requested
Go deeper on the security category. Apply the OWASP Top 10 checklist. Run a dependency audit:
```bash
npm audit
```

## What NOT To Do

- Don't flag stylistic preferences as critical findings
- Don't push unnecessary refactoring on working code
- Don't make suggestions that contradict the project's existing conventions (check CLAUDE.md)
- Don't review test files with the same strictness as production code
- Never apply fixes without asking the user first
